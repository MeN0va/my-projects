# 📘 Learning Playground

This repository is a personal learning space used to explore programming concepts, experiment with small projects, and document growth over time.
It is not a production-ready codebase, but rather a collection of learning artifacts created while studying C++, programming fundamentals, and related topics.
The structure and content of this repository will evolve as new languages, ideas, and experiments are added.

## ✨ Motivation

The goal of this repository is to:

* practice writing real code, not just isolated snippets
* learn by building small, complete programs
* understand trade-offs, limitations, and design decisions
* keep a visible record of progress and mistakes

**This repo exists primarily for _learning_ and _self-improvement_**.

## 📁 Repository Structure

```bash
Cpp/        → C++ learning projects
```

Each project lives in its own folder and includes a short README explaining what it does and what was learned.

## 🤝 Contributions

This is a personal learning project.
Contributions are not expected, but feedback and suggestions are welcome.
